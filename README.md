# Keyboard Remaps

## Goal

- reduce the responsibility of the right hand and its pinky finger
- smaller travel for common keys
- keep things simple and familiar


## Remaps

* `CapsLock` to `Esc`: easier to reach for Vim
* `ยง` (section key on the left of `1`) to `Backspace`: less right pinky travel
* `Option` + `ยง`  to `Delete`: less right pinky travel
* `F5`, `F6`, `F7`, `F8` to `Left`, `Down`, `Up`, `Right`: less right hand travel
* `F9` to `Return`: less right pinky travel
* `Option` + `Space` to `Enter`: less right pinky travel

## Application launch

`Command` + `Shift` + `...`

* `\`: Terminal
* `;`: VSCode
* `Space`: Browser
* `Enter`: Reminders
* `k`: Chat (Slack or Signal)
* `'`: Notes
* `8`: Password manager
* `7`: Spotify
  

## Setup

``` sh
brew install --cask karabiner-elements
```
